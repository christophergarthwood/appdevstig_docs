# Title: Communication Standard

## Definition:

A communication standard for a software development project is a set of clear rules and guidelines about how team members share information with each other and stakeholders. It explains the best ways and tools to use for talking about project updates, sharing documents, providing feedback, asking questions, and solving problems. The purpose is to keep everyone on the same page, avoid misunderstandings, and make sure important information doesnâ€™t get missed. Communication standards might include things like regular meetings, using certain chat apps or tools, documenting decisions, and being respectful and clear in all messages.

## Requirements/Specifications/Guidelines:

The requirement for a communication standard in a software development project is to ensure that everyone involved has a clear, consistent way to share information, updates, and feedback throughout the project. This standard reduces misunderstandings, prevents missed information, and helps everyone know when and how to communicate.

Minimal team member expectations in meetings:
  - Rules are to always remain professional, no profanity, positive attitude, always follow up.
  - Meetings have agendas and meeting minutes to follow (transformation of VTT authorized).

A good communication standard requires:

+ Identifying who needs to communicate (team members, stakeholders)

+ Deciding what information needs to be shared (progress, issues, requirements, decisions)

+ Setting clear rules for how and when to communicate (regular meetings, reports, chat channels, email etiquette)

+ Using templates or formats for documentation, updates, and reports to keep things organized and consistent

+ Assigning roles so everyone knows who is responsible for sending updates, scheduling meetings, or reporting issues

+ With these requirements, project communication becomes more reliable, efficient, and professional, keeping the whole team aligned and helping deliver successful software.

|Name               |Purpose          |Templates              |Roles                |Location          |Frequency |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|
|Community Messages |Messages regarding downtime or impacts to the application at large.| Email to managed distribution list in templated format. |Program Manager |Email|Variable|
|Security Alerts    |Subscription to each vendor's notification stream, DoD/IA notifications for cognizance of patches and vulnerabilities that are coming downstream to the team. Notify corresponding teams (OS, middle ware, database, etc.) of concerns, subject team coordinates with Project Manager and customer.| Email message with link to concern and calendar maintained with dates of deprecation, change, etc. for the project as a whole| Senior System Administrator |Email|Variable|
|Sprint Demonstration |Demonstrate functionality of completed stories to the Product Owner IAW Agile methodology.| Mutually agreed upon format. | All team members.|Virtual MS Teams|Monthly|
|Sprint Retrospective |Discuss class retrospective topics post demonstration IAW Agile methodology.| Standard template PM approved. | All team members.|Virtual MS Teams|Monthly|
|Sprint Backlog Grooming |Technical team members discuss backlog items and rack/stack stories based on a POA&M established with the sponsor.|Tracking System updates (living database) |Project Manager leads with, minimally, all senior team members in attendance.|Virtual MS Teams|Weekly|
|Sprint Daily Standup |Classic Agile daily 15-minute stand-up|Informal, MS Teams or in person meeting| All team members IAW Agile methodology.|Vitual MS Teams|Daily|
|Customer Meetings    |Requirements gathering, customer feedback, operational concerns, contracts.| An agenda for the meeting in question will be generated via email and meeting minutes to follow that trace back to the agenda submitted for the meeting highlighting: location, attendees, general discussion, action items.| Any team member.|Variable|Variable|

## Measurable and Actionable:

+ Sprint demonstrations and retrospective are an inspectable artifact that must exist after every Sprint.
+ Evidence of Senior Administrator tracking must exist (updates come out often, quarterly inspection by Program Manager).
+ Customer meetings must have an agenda and meeting minutes saved to project documentation folder specified by Program Manager.

## Purpose:

The purpose of a communication standard for software development is to create clear, consistent, and reliable ways for team members and stakeholders to share information throughout a project. This standard:

+ Ensures everyone knows how, when, and where to provide updates, ask questions, report progress, and resolve issues.

+ Reduces misunderstandings and confusion, saving time and preventing mistakes.

+ Provides a common language and approach so that collaboration is smooth, even with new team members or across different departments.

+ Makes it easier to document decisions and track project progress, leading to better organization and accountability.

+ Improves teamwork and the overall quality of the software by making sure important information is not missing and everyone stays aligned.

+ Ultimately, a communication standard helps keep a software development project on track, efficient, and successful.
