# Templates for Software Projects

## **Scope**

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of artifacts, grounded in other policies and standards, that help facilitate the development of software in a controlled yet flexible manner.  The intent is for the user to embrace the existence of the standard first, in other words recognize that you need **something** in place for that particular artifact.  Secondly, the reader should alter the standard or minimally utilize the standard to create an artifact that works for their team.  Skipping a standard or ignoring an artifact will likely result in a weakness within the project that will reveal itself over time, perhaps to the detriment of success.

## **Standard for Standards**

Utilize the following content as a means of establishing and validating a standard within this body of work.

+ Measurable and Actionable Statements: Clearly define what needs to be achieved and how compliance can be verified.

+ Specific and Concise: Avoid ambiguity and unnecessary detail, focusing on essential information.

+ Purpose and Rationale (Optional but Recommended): Explains why the standard is important, the benefits of adherence, and the risks of non-compliance.

+ How to Meet the Standard (Guidance or Methods): Provides information or methods for achieving the requirements outlined in the standard.                                                                                                                 
+ When to Meet the Standard (Timeframes/Policy Alignment): Indicates any deadlines or time-based requirements, and alignment with relevant policies.
