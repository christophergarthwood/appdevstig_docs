# Templates for Software Projects

## **Scope**

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of artifacts, grounded in other policies and standards, that help facilitate the development of software in a controlled yet flexible manner.  The intent is for the user to embrace the existence of the standard first, in other words recognize that you need **something** in place for that particular artifact.  Secondly, the reader should alter the standard or minimally utilize the standard to create an artifact that works for their team.  Skipping a standard or ignoring an artifact will likely result in a weakness within the project that will reveal itself over time, perhaps to the detriment of success.
