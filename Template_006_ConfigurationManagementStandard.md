# Title: Configuration Management Standard

## Definition:

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the process of keeping track of and controlling all the changes made to software throughout its development and use. In simple terms, it helps teams manage updates to the software, including code, documents, and settings, so that everything stays organized, consistent, and reliable.

In Software Configuration Management (SCM), the terms branch, trunk, and tag represent key concepts used in version control to organize and manage changes in the codebase:

Trunk: This is the main line of development where the most current and stable code resides. It represents the official version of the software that is under continuous development. Developers usually merge their completed and tested changes into the trunk.

Branch: A branch is a separate copy of the code created from the trunk (or another branch) to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Branches allow teams to develop or test changes in isolation. Once the work is stable and approved, it is merged back into the trunk. Branches can be short-lived (feature branches) or long-lived (release or maintenance branches).

Tag: A tag is a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time, often marking a release version like 1.0 or 2.1. Unlike branches, tags are typically immutable, meaning they are not changed after creation. Tags help identify important milestones, releases, or checkpoints in the code history.

Together, these concepts help teams manage multiple concurrent development efforts, maintain stable release versions, and track important states of the project efficiently. For example, the trunk holds ongoing development, branches are used for isolated changes, and tags mark stable releases or versions for future reference.

## Requirements/Specifications/Guidelines:

A Software Configuration Management (SCM) plan details how to manage and control changes to software products throughout their lifecycle. Its requirements generally include:

+ Configuration Management Objectives: Clearly state goals such as maintaining version consistency, traceability, and change control.

+ Configuration Identification: Define all software components to be managed (code, documents, libraries, tools) with unique identifiers for effective tracking.

+ Configuration Control: Establish procedures for submitting, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes, including authority roles.

+ Configuration Status Accounting: Specify how changes and current status of components will be recorded, reported, and tracked.

+ Configuration Audits and Reviews: Outline how audits will be conducted to ensure components meet standards and baseline requirements.

+ Tools and Technologies: Identify version control systems, build tools, and configuration management software that will be used.

+ Roles and Responsibilities: Define who is responsible for managing configuration activities, approvals, and implementation.

+ Change Management Process: Describe how change requests are handled, assessed for impact, and executed with minimal disruption.

+ Training and Documentation: Include plans for training personnel and maintaining up-to-date configuration documentation.

+ Risk Management: Identify potential risks related to configuration and strategies to mitigate them.

This structured approach ensures software integrity, supports collaboration, minimizes errors, and helps meet regulatory or organizational requirements throughout the software lifecycle.

## Measurable and Actionable:

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is measurable through a variety of metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that assess how effectively the SCM process is maintaining control, accuracy, and consistency of the software and related configuration items. Common measurable aspects include:

+ Compliance Rate: The degree to which configuration changes and processes adhere to defined SCM policies and standards.

+ Frequency of Updates: How often configuration items and records are updated, reflecting active management.

+ Number of Unauthorized Changes: Count of changes made without proper approval, indicating control lapses.

+ Change Success Rate: Percentage of changes implemented without causing incidents or requiring rollback.

+ Average Time to Identify and Correct Configuration Discrepancies: Measures responsiveness and efficiency of the SCM team.

+ Audit Coverage: Percentage of configuration items audited within a specified period to verify correctness.

+ Incident Impact Rate Due to Configuration Issues: Number or percentage of service incidents linked to configuration errors.

By regularly tracking these metrics, organizations can evaluate the effectiveness of their SCM processes, identify areas for improvement, and demonstrate compliance and risk management efforts. This data-driven approach ensures software integrity and supports reliable development and deployment cycles.

## Purpose:

SCM ensures that everyone knows what version of the software is being worked on, who made changes, and what those changes are. This helps avoid mistakes like overwriting work, losing important files, or introducing bugs. It also makes it easier to fix problems, roll back to earlier versions if needed, and keep software running smoothly over time. SCM is essential for teamwork, quality control, and managing complex software projects effectively.

## Timeliness:

SCM should occur ANY time a change is made to code using a Branch, Trunk, Tag methodology.
