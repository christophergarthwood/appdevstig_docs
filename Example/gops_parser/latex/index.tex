The goal of this project is to direct near real-\/time satellite data regarding the optical properties of the surface ocean into operational ocean models and coupled ocean-\/atmosphere models. These satellite data are presently processed and distributed by the Naval Oceanographic Office (N\-A\-V\-O\-C\-E\-A\-N\-O) for warfighter support, however, at present there is no mechanism that would direct these data into the operational ocean models. The present suite of operational models uses either a static table of optical attenuation coefficients that is based on Jerlovâ€™s early work (before the modern satellite era \mbox{[}Jerlov 1968\mbox{]}), or a static monthly climatology built from an obsolete N\-A\-S\-A mission (Sea\-Wi\-F\-S). As these operational models do not utilize any contemporaneous ocean optical attenuation data, the default attenuation and radiative transfer computations may result in gross errors for simulated upper ocean temperature structure, mixed layer depth, and substantial underestimates of air-\/sea thermal energy exchange rates. These errors will occur in spite of temperature data assimilation efforts because incorrect attenuation functions create structural problems in the way the ocean models calculate radiant heating throughout the upper water column. In coupled modeling systems, these errors will also impact the thermal energy balance within the simulated ocean-\/atmosphere systems and may have cascading effects on the forecasts for a wide range of tactically pertinent environmental variables, such as Electro-\/\-Magnetic (E\-M) duct heights. \hypertarget{index_my-intro}{}\section{V\-I\-S\-O\-R Overview}\label{index_my-intro}
