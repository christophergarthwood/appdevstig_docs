# Project Plan: [Project Name]

Utilize the template below to properly document by way of explicit input or references to other artifacts those data elements necessary to ensure any team member can obtain an understanding of the project.  Minimally the Project Manager (PM) should be the author and maintainer of these data elements and perform a monthly review to:

+ Ensure all standards are being embraced through the use of spot checks by direct inspection or delegation.
+ Update the Milestones and Timeline according to changes experienced per cycle / Sprint / iteration of work.
